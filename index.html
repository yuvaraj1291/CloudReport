                    <p><h4 style="font-style:italic;">The scholarly literature is expanding at a rate that necessitates intelligent algorithms for search and navigation. For the most part, the problem of delivering scholarly articles has been solved. The navigational aspect of scientific search – finding relevant, influential articles that one does not know exist – is in its early development. The schorlarly article recommendation helps in suggesting articles to the users based on citations, venues, authors and document similarity.  </h4></p>

                                   When we embark research on the project or some topic, we need to find necessary in-depth documents in our chosen research field. However, it would be helpful if we recommend papers related to the seed paper.

                                   We personally found it interesting because: Every student will gain knowledge from an article and in most of the cases, he will end up with few unanswered questions. Our system will quickly help the students to learn more.

                                According to this algorithm, citation is not the only factor that determines the importance of a paper, while other information such as authors, venues are also relevant. This implementation utilizes ranking publication using information about papers, authors, and venues. lack of improvement for public leaderboard results. The fun-damental idea is intuitive: good authors write good papers, and good papers are not only cited by many others, but also published in good journals or conferences.

                The data set is noisy. The articles with no author information, no publication information and no title information surprised us at every stage. So, our cool enhancement is the programming such that the system won't fail given any missing data.
                The manhattan distance used as a measure to compare articles in model based technique was challenging as it was giving irrelevant documents until we tried to converge the centroids as much acutely as possible. 
                The matrices dot product in citation based system was challenging with high computation time earlier. Our enhancement for that is to handle the matrix coordinates in a better way making the matrix dot product work in O(n) computation time.
                It was challenging to understand map equation implementation.

                   This implementation ranks articles using information about papers, authors, and venues.
                   The initial paper score is determined using the following equation

                            We selected the initial centers randomly from the vectors of each document
                            Then we executed Kmeans until the centers converge and then clustered the documents
                            Now when a user searches for a document, we locate the cluster in which the document is located and then compute the distance between the searched documents and the other documents in the cluster.
                            Finally we recommend the closest ones in the current document to the users.

                            Then we rank each article using “article level eigen factor algorithm” (ALEF). When page rank approaches are applied to acyclic citation graphs older papers are weighted excessively. ALEF is a modified version of page rank.
                            The ALEF algorithm consists of five steps: 
                            a.  The teleportation weight, wi for each node i is calculated by summing the in and out citations.
